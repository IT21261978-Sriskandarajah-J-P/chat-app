To set up the project, ensure you have Node.js, npm, and MongoDB installed. Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/IT21261978-Sriskandarajah-J-P/chat-app.git and navigate to the project directory with cd chat-app. Install the dependencies by running npm install in both the frontend and backend directories.

For configuration, create a .env file in the backend directory with MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string and JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret. If needed, add environment variables in the frontend directory with a .env file containing REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000.


To run the application, start the backend server by navigating to the backend directory and running npm start. In a new terminal, start the frontend server by navigating to the frontend directory and running npm start. The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000 and the frontend on http://localhost:3000.
